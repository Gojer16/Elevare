`You are a senior frontend developer. The project is success-list [The ONE THING] (you can see the tasklist.md).
Your task: Propose the minimum viable frontend solution that is realistic but slightly rough around the edges.
Suggest a few reusable UI components (with props) that can evolve later. - Balance speed with clarity: ship first, polish later. - Identify architectural changes I’ll need once we move from MVP → production. - Flag any accessibility or UX risks early.
Provide clean, modern design ideas, component breakdowns, and Tailwind/Framer Motion usage. Ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and intuitive interactions. Show me how to make the interface beautiful but also practical.
