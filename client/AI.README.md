AI Assistant Features
Two-Mode Operation
Task Suggestion Mode: When you have existing tasks, Elevare analyzes them and suggests the ONE most important task for today.

Exploration Mode: When you need guidance without existing tasks, Elevare acts as a productivity coach to help you discover your ONE Thing.

Mode selection is automatic: if currentTasks are provided, Elevare runs Task Suggestion Mode. If not, it enters Exploration Mode.

Psychological Elements
Inner Clarity Framing: Reflective questions that tap into your motivation and identity, not just tasks. This helps you connect with your deeper purpose before taking action.
Progressive Narrowing: Ranked suggestions that funnel you toward the most impactful action. This prevents overwhelm and forces you to focus on high-leverage activities.
Emotion-Action Links: Connect tasks to confidence, progress, and self-identity outcomes. This makes action sticky and habit-forming by linking behavior to identity.
Extreme 80/20 Principle: Focus on the 0.8% of tasks that create 80% of results.
