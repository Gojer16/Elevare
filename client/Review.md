Pretend you are a panel of senior engineers reviewing my system design. Critique the weaknesses, scalability issues, missing edge cases, integration pitfalls, and architectural risks. Suggest improvements. Be brutally honest as if this review happens before implementation.

Break down the approved system design into detailed subsystem documentation. For each subsystem, describe: purpose, inputs/outputs, dependencies, API contracts, data models, failure scenarios, and testing strategy. Format it so each subsystem can be handed off to a dev team.

_"Act as a senior engineer doing a code review. Review the following RP for readability, maintainability, performance, security, and adherence to best practices. Suggest changes as comments. Assume two-dev approval is required, so be thorough and critical.

Act as a security engineer. Review the design and codebase for project. Identify vulnerabilities, risks, and bad practices. Suggest fixes for authentication, authorization, data storage, API security, and XSS/CSRF/SQL injection prevention. Provide a checklist for secure deployment.
