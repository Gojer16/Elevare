## Overview

Elevare is a minimalist productivity app designed around one core principle: extraordinary results come from narrowing your focus.

Unlike endless to-do lists, Elevare helps you cut through the noise by identifying your **ONE** most important task each day — the single domino that, once knocked down, makes everything else easier or unnecessary.

## Philosophy

- **Go Small** - Doing the most important thing is always the most important thing.
- **Domino Effect** - Success builds sequentially — one meaningful task at a time.
- **Success Lists ≠ To-do Lists** - Most to-dos are noise. Elevare guides you toward the vital few that truly matter.
- **Extraordinary > Busy** - Don't focus on doing more; focus on doing what matters most.

> "Success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right."

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Daily Focus** — Commit to your single most important task each day.
- ✅ **Completion & Reflection** — Mark tasks as complete and reflect to build awareness and growth.
- 📊 **Archive & Progress** — See your journey unfold through archived tasks and reflections.
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication** — Built with NextAuth.js + Prisma for safe, private accounts.
- 🏷️ **Tags** — Organize tasks by life area (#Health, #Work, #Relationships).
- 🏆 **Gamification** *(Planned)* — Rewards and streaks to keep you consistent.
